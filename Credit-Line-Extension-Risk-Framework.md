# The Credit Line Extension Risk Framework

Contract-to-contract (C2C) lending will be one of Mars key features and differentiators. C2C lending, as its name indicates, refers to lending activity that happens between Mars and other smart contracts (thus contract-to-contract), as opposed to between Mars and individual users. From the point of view of other protocols, C2C lending will be a powerful tool that could allow them to innovate on top of Mars by tapping into its liquidity. For Mars, on the other hand, these protocols will effectively represent a new source of demand for the protocol, making its money markets more attractive for depositors and the whole protocol more useful.
Naturally, C2C lending also poses additional risks for Mars. These risks stem from a number of different sources, from the particular use case given to the borrowed assets to the technical and centralization risks associated with the smart contract (SC) borrowing the assets. In this sense, one of the most important goals when designing Mars C2C lending capabilities was to develop a robust and conservative architecture that would maximize the safety of user funds.
One of the tools intended for this purpose is the C2C lending risk framework, which aims to mitigate the risks involved in this process by standardizing the way in which those risks are measured and providing a conservative and thorough methodology for determining:
Content on this page should be migrated to GitHub with the title Credit Line Extension Risk Framework: 

1. Whether a given SC[^1] should be extended a loan. 
2. The specific risk parameters associated with that loan.

    [^1]: This framework will specifically focus on SCs requesting loans to deploy them in leveraged yield farming strategies, but could be expanded eventually to incorporate other use cases.
